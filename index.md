### Welcome!

I'm an undergraduate student of Polish Language and Literature at the [Federal University of Paraná](https://www.ufpr.br/) (UFPR) in Brazil.

My general academic interests are the description of natural languages using the Categorial Grammar formalism, the usage of Hidden Markov Models in statistical natural language processing, and their respectively computational applications in [PROLOG](https://www.swi-prolog.org/), [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/). 

I'm currently working with the reconstruction of the core case markers of Proto-Nakh-Daghestanian, under the guidance of [Prof. Márcio Renato Guimarães, PhD.](https://marciorenato.wordpress.com/)

I'm also a member of the [Linguistic Typology Lab](http://latip.com.br/) (LATIP), based at the [Federal University of Bahia](https://www.ufba.br/) (UFBA), collaborating with a web platform of statistical analysis of linguistic data, under the guidance of [Prof. João Paulo Lazzarini Cyrino, PhD.](http://lattes.cnpq.br/0607604801534336) In this lab, I mainly work with the data of Nakh-Daghestanian languages (namely Aghul, Tsakhur and Khwarshi).
