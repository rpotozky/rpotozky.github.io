### Welcome!

I'm an undergraduate student of Polish Language and Literature at the [Federal University of Paraná](https://www.ufpr.br/) (UFPR) in Brazil.

My general academic interests are the description of natural languages using the Categorial Grammar formalism, the usage of Hidden Markov Models in statistical natural language processing, and their respectively computational applications in [PROLOG](https://www.swi-prolog.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/). 

I'm currently researching the situation of the Kartvelian languages in the Nostratic Hypothesis, under the guidance of [Prof. Márcio Renato Guimarães, PhD.](https://marciorenato.wordpress.com/)

I'm also a member of the [Linguistic Typology Lab](http://latip.com.br/) (LATIP), based on the [Federal University of Bahia](https://www.ufba.br/) (UFBA), collaborating with a web platform of statistical analysis of linguistic data, under the guidance of [Prof. João Paulo Lazzarini Cyrino, PhD.](http://lattes.cnpq.br/0607604801534336)

I'm receiving a scholarship from the [Pro-Rectory of Culture and Science Outreach](http://www.proec.ufpr.br), of the [Federal University of Paraná](https://www.ufpr.br/) (PROEC/UFPR), for my participation in the [Languages in Dialog](#) project of regional, minority and minorised languages awareness. In this project I coordinate the [Minorised Languages Study Group](#), which has regular open meetings every weak.
