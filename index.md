### Welcome!

I'm an undergraduate student of Polish Language and Literature at the [Federal University of Paraná](https://www.ufpr.br/) (UFPR) in Brazil.

My general academic interests are the formal description of natural languages using the Categorial Grammar, the usage of Hidden Markov Models in statistical natural language processing, and their respectively computational applications in [PROLOG](https://www.swi-prolog.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/). 

I'm currently researching the situation of the Kartvelian languages in the Nostratic Hypothesis, under the guidance of [Prof. Márcio Renato Guimarães, PhD.](https://marciorenato.wordpress.com/).

I'm also a member of the [Linguistic Typology Lab](http://latip.com.br/) (LATIP), based on the [Federal University of Bahia](https://www.ufba.br/) (UFBA), collaborating with a web platform of statistical analysis of linguistic data, under the guidance of [Prof. João Paulo Lazzarini Cyrino, PhD.](http://lattes.cnpq.br/0607604801534336).

I'm receiving a scholarship of the [Pro-Rectory of Science Outreach and Culture](http://www.proec.ufpr.br), at the [Federal University of Paraná](https://www.ufpr.br/) (PROEC/UFPR), for my participation in the "Languages in Dialog" project of regional, minority and minorised languages awareness.
